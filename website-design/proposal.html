      <h1>My Personal Site: Project Proposal</h1>

    <h2>What Is It?</h2>
    <p>
      For my WebTech term project, I would like to create a personal site where
      I can post my resume and projects, and also maintain a blog.
    </p>
    <h2>Why This?</h2>
    <p>
      I have always seen personal websites as a very cool thing. It can be a
      terrific canvas to express yourself, even more than social media.
    </p>
    <h2>Who Is My Targert Market?</h2>
    <p>
      I would like my friends and family to visit the site, especially those who
      I do not keep in touch with at a regular basis. I would also like
      employers or coworkers to see the page.
    </p>
    <h2>What Content Do I Plan to Include?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Intro Page (Short Description of Myself)</li>
      <li>Resume Page (Pretty Much What I'd Put on LinkedIn</li>
      <li>Projects Page (Includes the projects I'm currently working on)</li>
      <li>Blog Page (Small blog I hope to maintain)</li>
      <li>Gallery (Photos of places I've been)</li>
      <li>Restaurant Recommendations (Good Restaurants I've Been To)</li>
      <li>Possible: list of services I want to self-host for public use</li>
    </ul>
